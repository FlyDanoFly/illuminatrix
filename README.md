# Illuminatrix

Controller and program code.
Trying out AI helping me along.

# TODO
- Get a basic gameloop and framework to communicate lighting and sound to towers, or as a whole system

# Point of order: Good notes! 
I should do some real note taking so that I can get this working again if I lose everything
Maybe go full on Obsitian notes so I can have different sections
...start from scratch?
sigh 
might be best in the long term, I'm continually forgetting what I did last time and it take hours to get back there
And when I have notes I do it faster
OK....
sigh...
From the card wipe onwards :-/



OK UPDATE!
I got the basic setup with the RPi and lots of "proper" notes with Obsidian
I'm going to check everything in as a milestone
Future work will be on the RPi and backported to this box
Big deal to get working today is sound
(And all the other things)
I'm going to make a big commit, then connect my RPI up to my GitHub and pull down the repository

OK, instead of one big commit, I made a modest one that starts all the notes
I think I might start off with JUST getting jack working on the Raspberry Pi
